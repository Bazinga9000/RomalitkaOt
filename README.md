This is a bot for the Puzzlers of Nondeterministic Designation to aid in puzzlehunting.

To use the `'get` and `'query` commads, you need to download the data files, which can be found [here.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/208400802404892672/874786502478024724/data.zip)
Put these json files into `assets/data` and the bot will load them at start.
